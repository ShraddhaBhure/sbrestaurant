# Microservices-based E-Commerce Application

Welcome to the Microservices-based E-Commerce application built using .NET 8. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive example of developing a real microservices architecture. It covers foundational elements, authentication and authorization with .NET Identity, and leverages technologies like Entity Framework Core and Ocelot API Gateway.

## Key Highlights and Topics Covered:

### Foundational Elements
Learn the basics of microservices by building a real application step by step.

### Technology Stack
Utilize the latest technologies, including .NET 6, .NET API, Ocelot, .NET Identity, Entity Framework Core, and clean architecture principles.

### Modules Developed
1. **Product Microservice**: Manages product information.
2. **Shopping Cart Microservice**: Handles shopping cart functionalities.
3. **Ordering Microservice**: Takes care of order processing.
4. **Payment Microservice**: Manages payment transactions.
5. **Email Microservice**: Responsible for sending email notifications.
6. **.NET Identity Microservice**: Handles authentication and authorization.
7. **Coupon Microservice**: Manages coupon-related functionalities.
8. **Ocelot Gateway Project**: Implements an Ocelot gateway for effective microservices communication.
9. **MVC Web Application**: Provides a user interface for the E-Commerce application.

### Communication Patterns
Explore both asynchronous and synchronous communication between microservices. Utilize Azure Service Bus for Topics and Queues to enhance communication reliability.

### Gateway Implementation
Implement an Ocelot gateway to facilitate communication between microservices effectively.

### Authorization and Authentication
Implement role-based authorization using .NET Identity. Learn the basics of identity server for enhanced security.
